# CYBT-213043-MESH

### Overview

The EZ-BT Mesh Evaluation Kit (CYBT-213043-MESH) enables you to evaluate SIG Mesh functionality and features using the EZ-BT AIROC&#8482; Module CYBT-213043-02. The CYBT-213043-02 EZ-BT AIROC&#8482; Module is an integrated, fully certified, 12.0 mm x 16.61 mm x 1.70 mm, programmable dual-mode Bluetooth&#174; module designed to reduce your time-to-market. The CYBT-213043-02 module utilizes the Infineon CYW20819 silicon device.

Each mesh board included in the CYBT-213043-MESH kit features following:

* CYW20819-based dual-mode (LE/BR/EDR) Bluetooth&#174; 5.0-compliant fully certified module (CYBT-213043-02)
* 1MB External Serial Flash
* FCC, ISED, MIC, and CE Certified Module on board (CYBT-213043-02)
* Bluetooth&#174; 5.0 with SIG MESH Qualified Module (CYBT-213043-02)
* USB connector for power, programming, and USB-UART bridge
* CYBT-213043-02 certified module based on CYW20819
* Sensors - Thermistor, Ambient Light Sensor (ALS), and PIR motion sensor
* RGB LED
* User switch
* Power measurement jumper
* Coin-cell battery holder (battery is not included in the kit)
* Option to select between USB power and coin-cell as power source
* On-board programmer and USB-UART bridge

### Additional Information

The CYBT-213043-02 module utilizes the Infineon CYW20819 silicon device. CYW20819 is an ultra-low-power (ULP) and highly integrated dual-mode Bluetooth&#174; 5.0 qualified device. The CYW20819â€™s low-power and integration capability addresses the requirements of both battery- and wall-powered applications that require Bluetooth&#174; LE mesh, such as sensor nodes, locks, lighting, blind controllers, asset tracking, and many more Smart Home applications.

CYBT-213043-MESH kit is supported in ModusToolbox&#8482; IDE 2.0 with BTSDK 2.0 or later. Infineon provides a number of code examples and snip codes for mesh functionality on GitHub. These code examples that allow you to implement real-life mesh application such as a dimmable light (bulb), dimmer and a thermometer and likes just in few minutes. These code examples can be searched and imported within ModusToolbox&#8482;.

Max UART baud rate is 1M. Use baud rate of 115200 for Client Control.

External 32 kHz LPO is used by default. To operate without external LPO, set USE\_32K\_EXTERNAL\_LPO=0 on the make command line or edit the default value in CYBT-213043-MESH.mk.
